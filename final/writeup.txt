Data did not have headers, so I added them.

It also had some missing data in the form of question marks.
    To fix this, I changed them to -1 using vim and them used the simple imputer
    to change them to the most occuring value of the column.
    I chose this method because the features that have missing data
    do not contain continuious data.

Before running any tests on the data, I wanted to get some information about the data.
To do this, I used pandas .info() function and .describe() function.
These layed out what types of data I am dealing with and statistics of each.
All the data is in numberical float form except the y is an int between 0-4.
I also received information like the mean, standard deviation, min, and max. 
This helped me to get a sense of what the data may look like and see if any feature i
has any data that may stick out and be an outlier.


I then created a heatmap based on the correlation of the data to see if any 
features stuck out. None stuck out very much, as they were all fairly under 50%,
but there was one feature that has a fairly high negative correlation to y.
This feature was the thal. This could also be because of the negative values put in 

I then tried to get a baseline for how a few classifiers would do and I tried
random forest, adaboost, and gradient boost.  

All three classifiers gave me about 40 - 60 percent accuracy depending on the run and data
