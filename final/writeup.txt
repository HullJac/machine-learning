Data did not have headers, so I added them.

It also had some missing data in the form of question marks.
    To fix this, I changed them to -1 using vim and them used the simple imputer to 
    change them to the mean of the column


I then tried to get a baseline for how a few classifiers would do and I tried
random forest, adaboost, and gradient boost.  
All three classifiers gave me about 40 - 60 percent accuracy depending on the run and data
